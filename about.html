                I am a 23 year old finnish web developer with science and art background. I love to spend my free time
                renovating my home, playing and going on long walks with my dog. I love scifi and fantasy literature and

            <h3>More About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I have studied chemistry but have always been interested in web development. I was 10 years old when I
                made my first web page with HTML and CSS. While I was studying in the university I took computer science
                as my minor subject and was introduced to programming. During my studies I was an active member in
                student associations and became responsible for all kinds of tasks and projects including being a web
                master. That and my previous interest in web development created a spark to turn my hobby into a career.
                I took my first steps towards my new career in January 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member or a leader of a team. I
                especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high
                precision. I am talkative and sociable but also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on
                detailed work like programming or designing.
