                renovating my home, playing and going on long walks with my dog. I love scifi and fantasy literature and

            <h3>More About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I have studied chemistry but have always been interested in web development
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member or a leader of a team. I
                especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high
                precision. I am talkative and sociable but also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on
                detailed work like programming or designing.
